<h3>Completed Lectures, and Tentative Outline</h3>

In the first part of the course, we plan to look at basic covering/packing problems such as vertex cover, set cover, and minimum congestion routing. From the technical side, we will cover various algorithmic techniques (greedy, local search, primal-dual, LP rounding) which have different quality of approximation guarantees depending on the type of input instances.
In the second part, we will focus on resource allocation problems, such as max-min allocation, min-max allocation, and bin packing. Now the techniques will include designing PTASs, and rounding so-called configuration LPs, in addition to the ones described above.
In the final part, we will follow the same template for graph partitioning problems such as min cut, max cut, multi-cut, and sparsest cut. The techniques now additionally include SDP rounding and metric embeddings.

<h4><u>Student Presentations</u></h4>

This involves reading papers from other areas of computer science where the underlying problem tackled is related to some of the problems studied in this course. 
The overall goal is to get a sense of how real world problems are abstracted as crisp algorithms questions, and how their (exact or approximate) solutions are deployed back in the real world.
Students are expected to form groups of two, choose a paper, and present (a) the goal of the paper, (b) the underlying problem, (c) the solution provided in the paper, and (d) any other algorithms based on topics covered in class which might be applicable. 
The presentations are to be 20 minutes long.
